Thank you for visiting our website! This site was created for Reggi's BBQ; a 
restaurant in Jackson, Tennessee. Reggi's BBQ has been serving the best wings 
and barbecue in Tennessee for many years. We saw that the restaurant's official 
website was outdated and unresponsive to certain display types so we decided to
see what we could do in hopes of creating a site for the Dev Catalyst competion
as well as helping our favorite restaurant. 

Starting out was rocky at first; but once we started to understand HTML and CSS, 
it seemed almost second hand as we could do anything we wanted to with our newly 
gained skills. Working together as a team, we could solve any problem we that we 
encountered and could fine-tune our stie to our likings.

Our website includes many improvements and additions that the original Reggi's 
website did not include such as:
  •A clean, modern, and user-friendly design compared to their original site
  •A responsive website for all display types
  •Embedded social media postings from their Instagram account as well as links
  to their accounts on other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter
  •Actual customer reviews from Tripadvisor and Yelp
  •An improved catering and restaurant menu with uniform design (Their original
  website had conflicting designs between the catering and restaurant menu, one 
  was a PDF document and the other was just an image, our redesign made the two 
  have a simple and uniform design that was easier to read.)

Thank you!
Sincerely,
Luke Pjontek & Will Williams
